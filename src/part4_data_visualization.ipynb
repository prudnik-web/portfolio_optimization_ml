    "The treemap offers a snapshot of how your portfolio is distributed and what the forecasted performance looks like. The size of each block shows how much weight a stock has in your portfolio, while the color indicates its expected return—green for better performance and red for weaker outcomes. If a stock is forecasted to perform well but has a small weight, it might be worth increasing its allocation. Conversely, if a stock has a large weight but is expected to underperform, it could be time to reduce its presence. The “Others” section groups smaller allocations, which might signal an over-diversified portfolio that could benefit from more focus. Overall, this chart helps pinpoint areas for potential rebalancing to align with expected returns and improve the portfolio's efficiency."
